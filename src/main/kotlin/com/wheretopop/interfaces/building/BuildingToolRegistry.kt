        Retrieves detailed building information by address.
        Use this tool when a user requests specific information about a building at a particular address.
        Appropriate for questions like:
        - 'Tell me about the building at [address]'
        - 'What are the details of [building address]?'
        - 'Show me information for the building located at [address]'
        The generation includes:
        - Building ID and location (latitude/longitude)
        - Building specifications (height, floor counts)
        - Elevator information
        - Building usage details
        - Construction/approval information
        Returns an appropriate error message if the building is not found.
